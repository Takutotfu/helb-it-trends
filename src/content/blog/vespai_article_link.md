## Track Asian Hornets With VespAIs

### Introduction

[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com) projects have been known to push the boundaries of DIY electronics, and the VespAI project is no exception. Developed to help monitor the spread of invasive Asian hornets in Europe, this cutting-edge solution leverages machine learning, Raspberry Pi technology, and an open-source approach to make wildlife conservation more accessible.

### The Threat of Asian Hornets

Asian hornets, originally from Southeast Asia, have made their way into Europe and pose a serious threat to native bee populations. As these hornets spread rapidly across regions, scientists and environmentalists are increasingly looking for tools to track their movements and contain their spread. 

### VespAI

Enter VespAI, a lightweight AI-powered system designed to track the movement of Asian hornets in real time. The project utilizes the Raspberry Pi 4 paired with cameras and machine learning models to recognize and log the presence of hornets at monitoring stations. The open-source project is tailored for scalability, meaning communities can set up multiple devices to track hornet movement over a wide area.

#### How It Works

VespAIâ€™s machine learning model is trained to recognize Asian hornets and distinguish them from other insects. Once detected, the system logs the time and location of sightings and can even report the data to a central database for broader analysis. 

### Community Effort

The project is a testament to the power of community-driven initiatives. Thanks to its open-source nature, conservationists, tech enthusiasts, and concerned citizens can contribute to the project by building their own VespAI setups and sharing data to support larger conservation efforts.

### What Does This Mean for Conservation?

VespAI demonstrates the potential for low-cost, scalable solutions in the fight against invasive species. With more people able to deploy this technology, scientists can collect more comprehensive data on the spread of Asian hornets and respond more effectively to this growing threat.
