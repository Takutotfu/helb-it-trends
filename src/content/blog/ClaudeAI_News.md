## Claude AI can now fill forms and book a trip

Anthropic says its model can perform computer tasks, raising concerns that this technology might replace human workers.

### Introduction

Anthropic, an AI startup supported by Amazon and Google, has created an AI agent called Claude. This innovative tool can perform a variety of tasks on the computer, such as moving the mouse cursor and typing text. According to the company, Claude can now automate computing activities like filling out forms, planning events, and even building websites.

### The Rise of Autonomous AI Agents

Tech companies and investors view autonomous AI agents as a promising and profitable area for development. These advanced technologies have surprised users with their capabilities but require big investment, costing billions of dollars to create and maintain. Anthropic, which competes with OpenAI, is offering its Claude 3.5 model to developers, but the tool is still experimental and may make mistakes.


### Claude AI in Action

Anthropic made a demo where the AI model fills out a form using a fictional employee’s computer, using data from a table and open browser tabs. In other demonstrations, Claude planned a calendar appointment for a trip in San Francisco and created a basic website to promote itself. These examples illustrate the model’s ability to automate various tasks.


### Impacts on Jobs and the Future of Work

Anthropic told that Claude is designed to reduce work, such as form-filling and handling client queries, and to be seen as helpful assistants rather than job threats. However, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has warned that AI-driven automation could impact highly skilled jobs, which make up about a quarter of employment in its 38 member countries.
