## Cybersecurity in the industrial sector

Having a secure system is what's missing in the industrial sector. The proof is that the sector which is the most targeted by cybersecurity attacks is the industrial one !

### Introduction

Most cybersecurity attacks are made in the industrial field. This is clearly because companies dont secure enough and when they do, they don't know what they are doing. In a recent study it appears that 70% of the companies are not confident about the money they have put into security. Another problem is that nowadays, most off the internal software is stored on the cloud but often without adequate security or with minimal protection.

### Very dangerous and possibly mortal

Attacks in the industrial sector are especially dangerous due to the fact that the IT and OT (Operational Technology) are controlling critical machines and processes that directly impact physical operations.
OT controls equipment like pumps, motors, boilers, or industrial robots. If attackers gain control, they can cause severe accidents such as explosions, fires, or malfunctions that endanger workers. A lot of industries also store chimical materials which could make worse the situation. But there are a lot of other accidents possible, like an attack on automated engines or trains which could result in fatalities.


### Examples of past attacks

Asco is a company manufactures aircraft parts. In 2019, they were victim of a devastating ransomware which caused a damage of more than 20 millions euros and a shutdown of the production for a whole month. 
Another example is the Picanol group, known for manufacturing textiles machines. They were also victim of a ransomware, forcing them to shut down all their factories worldwide. In Belgium for 200 days. The cost wasn't told publicly but it is also estimated in millions of euros.
In the case the company stil wants to continue its activity, the only option is to use pen and paper or apps like Excel.


### Prevent this attacks with IT and OT

IT and OT struggle to understand each other, as they operates with different priorities and environments. IT focuses on data security, while OT prioritizes the continuity and safety of physical operations.
However to prevent the attacks it is necessary to integrate IT with OT and to have a continuous communication between both.
Many companies use the same programs as long as they work, but this is a big problem because some vulnerabilities appears with the time and it is mandatory to fix them. Also the programs are so old that the current workers dont understand them anymore and the poeole who did are now retired.
