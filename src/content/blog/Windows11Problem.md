## Microsoft Pauses Windows 11 24H2 Update Due to Bugs

The latest Windows update issue is impacting specific Asus PCs. Here's why it's best to avoid the update, even if your device isn't affected.

### Introduction

Microsoft has temporarily blocked the Windows 11 24H2 update for certain PCs due to a series of bugs. The company advises caution, even for those whose devices are not directly affected, and offers guidance on how to come back to an earlier version if needed.

### Bugs Affecting the Update

Since its release on October 1, the Windows 11 24H2 update had numerous issues. These include the System File Checker malfunction, mouse pointer disappearing, internet connection problems, fingerprint sensor errors, and even the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD). In response, Microsoft has paused the update rollout for affected PCs as it works to resolve these problems.


### Other Hardware and Software Conflicts

In addition, compatibility issues with Intel’s Alder Lake+ processors, integrated cameras, and applications like Easy Anti-Cheat have prompted Microsoft to halt updates for certain configurations. Various other bugs related to Intel drivers, fingerprint sensors, and specific apps like Asphalt 8 are still being investigated, as these problems continue to disrupt the update process.


### Advice for Users

For those who have already installed the problematic update, Microsoft provides a rollback option. Users can revert to the previous version of Windows 11 through the Recovery settings, ensuring their systems remain functional until Microsoft resolves the issues. For those who haven't yet updated, the recommendation is to delay installation until most bugs are fixed.
