# 8 Tips for a Reliable Software Design

When we want to design software, there's a whole thought process starting in our minds which we might sometimes be totally unaware of due to our experience. Still, some parts of it are different from one programmer to another, so here's a short list of tips which should help making the right decisions when designing our applications.

## 1. Use Off-The-Shelf Solutions First

If there’s a tool that already exists — like Redis for caching for example — don’t reinvent the wheel. Unless your project has specific needs that an already exisiting solution can’t handle, it’s faster and easier to use what's available.

## 2. Focus on Cost and Reliability Over Features

When carrying out a project, it’s tempting to add all the features you can think of, but reliable software is much more valuable. Once you have something reliable, adding features is easier than trying to add reliability to something full of features. Start small, focus on making it stable, and expand from there.

## 3. Get from Idea to Production Quickly

The faster you can deploy your code into production, the quicker you’ll learn what features are actually required. Often, you won’t know exactly what’s needed until you see it in action and receive feedback. So, build a minimal version, deploy it, and adjust based on real end users feedback.

## 4. Keep Data Structures Simple

Complex data structures can introduce bugs and make your software harder to understand and maintain, while making it sometimes hard to handle in the code itself. The simpler the structure, the easier it is to optimize and troubleshoot. To build a cache memory, for example, you can limit yourself to an array and hashing — no need for anything more tedious.

## 5. Reserve Resources Early

This one is particularly interesting: it consists in allocating resources, like memory, early on in the execution flow of your project. This way, if there’s not enough memory or other resources, the system will crash early, saving you from middle-of-the-night failures in production.

## 6. Set Limits to Avoid Worst-Case Scenarios

Whether it’s the number of steps in a search or the amount of memory you can use, it’s important to set maximums, e.g. a limit which cannot be crossed no matter what. Even if the limit isn’t perfect, just having one ensures you don’t hit an unexpected bottleneck later on.

## 7. Make Testing Simple and Necessary

Testing shouldn’t be an afterthought. The easier it is to test your software, the more likely you are to catch issues early. For example, a simple command line testing option for a cache makes it extremely simple to test just using a file. Its instructions would be piped to the cache, as would be a whole test protocol.

## 8. Track Performance with Counters

Embedding performance counters in your code — like tracking how often cache misses happen  in case of a cache memory development — can give you insight into how your software behaves over time. It helps spot patterns or problems that you wouldn’t see otherwise, especially under different loads.

## Conclusion

Please note that this is not all the aspects you should stay aware of when developing software, but these should definitely help you build applications with better designs. See it as a reminder to keep things straightforward and avoid over-engineering a solution.
