## RSA encryption broken with a quantum computer by chinese researchers

The research team, led by Wang Chao from Shanghai University, found that D-Wave’s quantum computers can optimize problem-solving in a way that makes it possible to attack encryption methods such as RSA.

### RSA

RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Its security relies on the computational difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, which, with classical computing methods, is nearly impossible to solve within a reasonable time frame without the private key. This makes RSA highly secure for protecting data from unauthorized access

### The demonstration

Chinese researchers have demonstrated a method using D-Wave's quantum annealing systems to break classic encryption, suggesting a significant threat to global cybersecurity. Their study, published in the Chinese Journal of Computers, showed how D-Wave's quantum computers could break RSA encryption and target symmetric encryption systems like AES. The researchers successfully factored a 22-bit RSA integer and attacked other algorithms, including Present and Gift-64. The research highlights the need for post-quantum cryptographic solutions as quantum computing increasingly poses a threat to current encryption standards.

### Threat for Cybersecurity ?

The research indicates that quantum computers may be able to break current encryption sooner than expected, posing a serious threat to data security, privacy, and cryptographic principles like confidentiality and integrity. Experts warn that data encrypted today could be vulnerable if adversaries collect it now to decrypt in the future as quantum technology advances, highlighting the urgent need for reassessing cryptographic security.


### Quantum-safe encryption

Many companies are developing "quantum-safe" encryption methods, but recent Chinese research highlights the urgent need for their implementation to protect sensitive data. The study from Wang Chao's team serves as a wake-up call for the cybersecurity community, stressing that quantum computing's rapid evolution necessitates immediate action to rethink encryption strategies. Experts emphasize that post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is essential to prevent advanced cyberattacks enabled by quantum computers.
