## Rising Threat of AI in Creating Child Abuse Images

The use of AI tools to create explicit images of children is posing new challenges for U.S. prosecutors. The growing threat, legal challenges, and efforts to prevent AI-generated child abuse content.

### Introduction

AI technologies are advancing rapidly, and with it comes the risk of misuse. U.S. federal prosecutors are increasingly facing cases involving the use of AI to generate child abuse images. The Justice Department is raising concerns about the normalization of these images and how the technology could lead to a surge in illicit content.

### The legal challenge

These cases are testing the limits of existing USA laws. Prosecutors are navigating uncharted territory, especially when the images do not involve identifiable real children. In some instances, the Justice Department is applying obscenity laws instead of child pornography laws, which may face challenges in court.


### Not guilty ?

Recent prosecutions include a software engineer accused of using an AI model to create and share explicit images with a minor, and a US Army soldier charged for using AI to manipulate innocent photos. Both defendants have pleaded not guilty, and their cases raise questions about constitutional rights and the use of AI-generated imagery.


### How to prevent ?

Advocacy groups and major tech companies, including Google, Amazon, Meta, and OpenAI, are working together to prevent AI systems from generating abusive images. These groups have secured commitments from AI developers to avoid using harmful content to train their models and to actively monitor their platforms for such imagery.
