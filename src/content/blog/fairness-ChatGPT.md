## Designing Models for Fairness
Creating effective language models involves more than just data; it requires a carefully designed training process to mitigate harmful outputs and enhance usefulness. Research indicates that language models, including ChatGPT, can inadvertently perpetuate social biases from their training data, such as gender and racial stereotypes.

## Influence of User Identity
This study investigates how subtle cues related to a user's identity, particularly their names, can affect the responses generated by ChatGPT. This is significant because users engage with chatbots for diverse purposes—ranging from drafting resumes to seeking entertainment—different from traditional AI fairness research scenarios like credit scoring.

## First-Person Fairness
While past research has centered on third-person fairness, where AI impacts decisions about others, this study focuses on first-person fairness, analyzing how biases may directly affect users interacting with ChatGPT. The study examines how ChatGPT's awareness of various users' names influences its responses, given that names often carry cultural, gender, and racial connotations.

## Memory Feature Implications
ChatGPT can retain information, such as users' names, across conversations unless the Memory feature is disabled. This capability adds another layer to understanding potential biases, especially as users frequently provide their names for tasks like email drafting.
