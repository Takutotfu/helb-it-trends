# Tanstack and Convex

## Sponsorship of TanStack Start
Convex has announced its sponsorship of TanStack Start, a new React framework developed by Tanner Linsley. This partnership aims to ensure seamless integration between Convex and TanStack Start, enhancing the developer experience. Currently in alpha, TanStack Start is a work in progress, with ongoing developments and features being fine-tuned.

## Integration with TanStack Query
The integration strategy begins with TanStack Query, a state management tool that has proven effective for various server communications, including those involving Convex's WebSocket connections. Recently, Convex released a beta version of its integration with TanStack Query, allowing for live updating queries and automatic invalidation, making it easier for developers to manage server states.

## Advancements in TanStack Start
With TanStack Query established, the integration of TanStack Start with Convex is progressing well. Key features such as server-side rendering and automatic hydration of live updates are now functional, providing a smooth experience during navigation. However, as the framework is still in alpha, users can expect some breaking changes as it matures.
