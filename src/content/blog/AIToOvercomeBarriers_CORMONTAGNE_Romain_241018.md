# Smart devices which help overcome daily barriers

During the Cybathlon 2024, showcasing how assistive technologies can help people with disabilities overcome everyday barriers, the ETH teams are coming with innovative solutions to be tested by diasabled people.

## ALMA: The Four-Legged Robot

ALMA, developed by the Robotics Systems Lab at ETH Zurich, is a quadrupedal robot controlled by a paraplegic pilot via a mouth-operated joystick (quadstick). Unlike assistive robots attached to wheelchairs, ALMA operates autonomously, providing greater mobility. The robot helps with tasks like opening doors or holding objects for the pilot. The development team has refined the control system to reduce the learning curve for the pilot, making ALMA more intuitive. While the robot holds promise for future deployment in everyday life, it is still in the experimental phase.

## Sight Guide: Navigational Aid for the Blind

The Sight Guide team of ETH Zurich equips blind pilots with two cameras, a 3D depth camera, and a hand-held third camera to help them navigate and perform tasks in a Vision Assistance Race. The data from these cameras is processed by a lightweight computer that the pilots carry, guiding them with audio instructions. Additionally, a vibrating belt helps them know which direction to move. This system has been developed in collaboration with one of the pilots, who provides feedback to improve the technology. The team is working on making the system faster and more reliable for everyday use.

## NeuroLegs: Sensory Feedback for Prosthetic Legs 

The NeuroLegs project aims to improve sensory feedback for users of prosthetic legs, allowing them to "feel" the ground beneath their foot. Sensors in the insole of the prosthetic gather data, which is processed by a computer and translated into electrical stimulation on the pilot’s leg stump. This real-time feedback mimics sensations that a natural foot would provide, making walking on uneven terrain or stairs easier. The team has improved the system’s usability and reliability, and is now considering whether to continue their research or turn the project into a business.

## Conclusion 

These innovations highlight the potential of robotics and sensory technology to enhance independence and quality of life for people with disabilities, pushing the boundaries of assistive technology into real-world applications.
